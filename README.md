# NOTE NOTE (All securities in the dataset are available to be accessed from application but data of all securities is not imported in MongoDB database. Data for securities on the first page are only imported)

First access to view ditails of a particular security will be a bit slow as on first access data gets imported from data folders into MongoDB database. Any further access to the same security will be very fast.
